    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In the <a href="./activity3 - Copy.html"> 9th of July, 2005</a>, Cythel Marie was born on the place of Magsaysay, Compostela Valley, Davao de Oro. Her Mother is Mergil Rusiana,<br/>
         and her father is Forunato Hidalgo Manait. When she was 2 years old, her family moved in Siay, Zamboanga Sibugay. Unfortunately,<br/>
         her father died when she was 4 years old. My mother beacme a widow, taking care of Cythel and her 2 siblings namely Charmiel Manait<br/>
         and Charmae Manait. </p>
    <p>She spent her elementary days at Coloran Elementary School and she graduated in year 2017. In her highschool, she went to Siay National <br/>
        High School where she developed her hobbies: drawing, reading, and watching animes. Her highschool was colorful and tough which opened <br/>
        her eyes about life. She graduated high school in year 2021 with honors. She also spent her senior highschool days at Siay National High <br/>
        School and graduated in year 2023 with honors. Fortunately she was granted a DOST Scholarship that can help her college, lifting her family's<br/>
        financial burden.
        </p>
    <p>At Western Mindanao State University main campus, she studied Bachelor of Science in Architecture. Her first year went well, she thought <br/>
        that she can excell in the field of architecture, considering that she's a scholar. However on her second year in studying her course, she <br/>
        can no longer see herself working in the field of architecture due to self pressure and disapointments. She also developed health concerns <br/>
        which hindered her from studying her course.So, she decided to shift to Computer Science in WMSU ESU Ipil campus and reverted to Islam <br/>
        because she thought that these can bring her peace and spark back. It is a tough decision to make but she pursued it. Now, she's studying in <br/>
        Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with her new faith. This transition allowed her to heal and to rediscover her new passion without <br/>
        the weight of her past anxieties. In this new environment, she finally found her spark back that she thought she had lost, proving that <br/>
        shifting paths isn't a failure but a brave step toward self-perseverance.
